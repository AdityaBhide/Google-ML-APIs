1,Avengers Infinity War,"It's a unique, exceptional achievement that somehow leaves you both fully satisfied and desperate for more, and ranks among the best adventures we've seen yet from this stellar franchise. One of the most overblown, predictable and ugly movies i ever had to sit thorugh. It jumped from one setpiece to another without any meaningful character interaction. I musters barely as a movie but felt like an episode of a TV show. The CGI was abysmal compared to the budget. The villain was unimpressive and there were no stakes in the final showdown beacause you know they will all come back for sequels spin-off etc.Baffling how this crap make gazillions of cash."
2,Deadpool 2,"Deadpool 2 is an outrageous, surprising, hysterical, emotional, vulgar, creative and uproarious summer blockbuster that fans of this genre -- and of comedy, in general -- will devour. I came out of this feeling rather empty, I think the action and some of the jokes were better than the first but overall it fell rather flat. I think this was an improvement. Sequel has all the elements in its right proportion - humour, emotion, story, action, super-heroes, villain - its definitely one step better than the first version. Movie is also evenly paced and does not lag anywhere for long and that''s what i liked the most."
3,Jurassic World-Fallen Kingdom,"Fallen Kingdom is a high class summer blockbuster, with some unexpected emotions, a heap of the action that one would expect from such a film, and a dash of surprisingly dark moments that folks have been waiting for since Michael Crichton's book first hit shelves. Better than the terrible lost world. But that's not saying much. Overall meh. The after credits was r3tarded. Don't wait. The only thing that can save this franchise is Spinosaurus and Grant. This movie was confusing. They kept throwing out clues like maybe it was the little girl who was the genetic mutation. It was a big mess at the end. I was glad to be out of there."

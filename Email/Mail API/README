This is a fun program that uses combination of translation, Speech-to-text APIs and the class EMAIL

Similar to the translation API, the transcript is translated into 4 different languages.
Then 4 files are created and the translated text into the 4 languages gets written into the respective 4 files created.
Now by using the EMAIL class, the 4 files are attached and sent via email to the target email id.

This folder has all the project examples using the Google Vision API

The first code is the DOGAPI.py :
  The user has to give the number of random dog images he/she wants as the input.
  This program then generates random dog images and also generates the url links to the dog images.
  It also downloads the images and stores them in the respective directories.
  
The second code is the DOGVISION.py :
  This is the actual program that uses the Google ML Vision API.
  It uses the above DopAPI and the requests the google vision api to analyze the downloaded dog images.
  The vision api uses label detection and gives us the info about the dog i.e it tells us about the type..breed..color.. etc.
